# Tic-Tac-Toe
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Introduction
This project's purpose is to build a Tic Tac Toe game using a game tree. The game is to be 
played between HUMAN and AI. One of the players chooses ‘O’ and the other ‘X’ to mark 
their respective cells and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/ 
column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character (‘O’ or ‘X’).

Problem Statement
Construct a Tic Tac Toe game using the game tree by implementing the MiniMax algorithm 
using depth-first search.

Objectives
The objective of the following project is to construct a two-player tic-tac-toe game using a 
game tree and minimax function. In the following tic-tac-toe game, the win ratio for the 
player should be 0, meaning only artificial intelligence should win the game.
